TOPIC: Perseverance
REFERENCE: James 1
VERSE: James, a servant of God 
and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: 
Greetings.
Consider it pure joy, my brothers, 
whenever you face trials of many kinds,
because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
Perseverance must finish its work 
so that you may be mature and complete, 
not lacking anything.
If any of you lacks wisdom, 
he should ask God, 
who gives generously to all without finding fault, 
and it will be given to him.
But when he asks, 
he must believe and not doubt,
because he who doubts 
is like a wave of the sea, 
blown and tossed by the wind.
That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;
he is a double-minded man,
unstable in all he does.
The brother in humble circumstances 
ought to take pride in his high position.
But the one who is rich 
should take pride in his low position, 
because he will pass away like a wild flower.
For the sun rises with scorching heat 
and withers the plant; 
its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. 
In the same way, 
the rich man will fade away
even while he goes about his business.
Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, 
because when he has stood the test, 
he will receive the crown of life
that God has promised to those who love him.
When tempted, 
no one should say, 
"God is tempting me." 
For God cannot be tempted by evil, 
nor does he tempt anyone;
but each one is tempted when,
by his own evil desire, 
he is dragged away and enticed.
Then, after desire has conceived, 
it gives birth to sin; 
and sin, 
when it is full-grown, 
gives birth to death.
Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.
Every good and perfect gift is from above, 
coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, 
who does not change like shifting shadows.
He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, 
that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
My dear brothers, 
take note of this: 
Everyone should be quick to listen, 
slow to speak 
and slow to become angry,
for man's anger 
does not bring about the righteous life 
that God desires.
Therefore, 
get rid of all moral filth 
and the evil that is so prevalent
and humbly accept the word planted in you, 
which can save you.
Do not merely listen to the word, 
and so deceive yourselves. 
Do what it says.
Anyone who listens to the word
but does not do what it says 
is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror
and, after looking at himself,
goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
But the man who looks intently
into the perfect law that gives freedom, 
and continues to do this, 
not forgetting what he has heard,
but doing it--
he will be blessed in what he does.
If anyone considers himself religious 
and yet 
does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, 
he deceives himself 
and his religion is worthless.
Religion that God our Father accepts 
as pure and faultless 
is this: 
to look after orphans and widows in their distress 
and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

TOPIC: Perseverance-short
REFERENCE: James 1:2-4

TOPIC: Philippians 3
REFERENCE: Philippians 3:7-21
VERSE: But whatever was to my profit 
I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
What is more, 
I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, 
for whose sake I have lost all things. 
I consider them rubbish, 
that I may gain Christ
and be found in him, 
not having a righteousness of my own
that comes from the law, 
but that which is through faith in Christ--
the righteousness that comes from God
and is by faith.
I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection 
and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, 
becoming like him in his death,
and so, somehow, 
to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Not that I have already obtained all this, 
or have already been made perfect, 
but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it.
But one thing I do: 
Forgetting what is behind 
and straining toward what is ahead,
I press on toward the goal 
to win the prize 
for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
All of us who are mature 
should take such a view of things.
And if on some point you think differently, 
that too God will make clear to you.
Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
Join with others in following my example, brothers, 
and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
For, as I have often told you before 
and now say again 
even with tears, 
many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
Their destiny is destruction, 
their god is their stomach, 
and their glory is in their shame. 
Their mind is on earthly things.
But our citizenship is in heaven. 
And we eagerly await a Savior from there, 
the Lord Jesus Christ,
who, by the power that enables him 
to bring everything under his control, 
will transform our lowly bodies
so that they will be like his glorious body.

TOPIC: Philippians 4

Let your gentleness be evident to all.

but in everything, 
by prayer and petition, 
with thanksgiving, 
present your requests to God.
And the peace of God, 
which transcends all understanding, 
will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
Finally, brothers, 
whatever is true, 
whatever is noble, 
whatever is right, 
whatever is pure, 
whatever is lovely, 
whatever is admirable--
if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--
think about such things.
Whatever you have learned 
or received 
or heard from me, 
or seen in me--
put it into practice. 
And the God of peace 
will be with you.
I rejoice greatly in the Lord 
that at last you have renewed your concern for me. 
Indeed, you have been concerned, 
but you had no opportunity to show it.
I am not saying this because I am in need, 
for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
I know what it is to be in need,
and I know what it is to have plenty. 
I have learned the secret of being content 
in any and every situation,
whether well fed or hungry,
whether living in plenty or in want.
I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
